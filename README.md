# SavingsAccount
My savings account requires a monthly transfer from my checking every month. I wanted to see how much I would have at the end of x years if I increased the monthly transfer amount by y every year.

Note: Will not be taking interest into account (see what I did there?) as it's next to nothing on Chase Savings.
